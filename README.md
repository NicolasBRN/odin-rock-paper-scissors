# odin-rock-paper-scissors
At the moment, this project is made with html, css and js, with the formula of the classic "rock-paper-scissors" game, with a twist with cards.
The card images are made by me using Inkscape, as well as the retry icon at the top left corner.

For now, it will be in this state, in the next days, i will be updating the code to make it more efficient and cleaner to look at, thanks for passing by.
